	take one variable as an argument, split into the dd-mm-yyyy format, and adds one day. Accounting for how this will change the month/year, including leap years.

* before:
	take one variable as an argument, split into the dd-mm-yyyy format, and SUBTRACTS one day. Accounting for how this will change the month/year, including leap years.
